 **Machine Learning Project-
   Hand Written Digit Prediction Classification Analysis

Project Description:
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits. The dataset used is the well-known MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). The model will predict the digit in the image by analyzing its pixel values.
